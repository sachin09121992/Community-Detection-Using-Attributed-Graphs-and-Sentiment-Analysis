Each of the team member came up with a business problem based on the yelp data set.
We then finalized one of them as the target question. 
In implementing an end to end business solution for the same, the contribution of the team members is given below:

1) Jitin Kumar (jkumar3) : Pre-processing the data set, extracting the attributes of users and discretize them
2) Sachin Ahuja (sahuja3) : Extracted user reviews and perfomed sentiment analysis using doc2vec as feature builder and Naive Bayes as the classification algorithm to find overall sentiment for each user.
3) Udit Deshmukh (udeshmu) : Created an edge list of users and their friends. Implemented the SAC-1 algorithm to find the communities using the edge list and the user attributes. 

All the team members had equal contribution to the final report.
